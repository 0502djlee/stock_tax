# stock_tax
Automatically files a tax report for stock transactions based on an PDF report or a CSV report from E-Trade.

** DISCLAIMER **

This code is not perfect. While it has worked for the tests I have used, it may not work for other reports. Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for your actions(meaning that no legal action can be taken against me).


There are 2 versions that can process both PDF reports and CSV reports: "REAL_pdf_csv_python2.py" and "REAL_pdf_csv_python3.py"

To use these, you must first choose which type of reports you are inputting(PDF or CSV), then enter the necessary information(including the names of the files). Remember to include the file name extension when entering your file names(also your files should be in the same directory as this code).

The output files should be PDFs that are separated by length(short or long).

Once again, this tool is not too developed, and has not been tested for many test cases, so use at your own risk.
